# pug-plain-loader

A loader that simply compiles pug templates into HTML.

## Installation

Note `pug` is a peer dependency, so make sure to install both:

``` sh
npm install -D pug-plain-loader pug
```

## Usage

This loader is mostly intended to be used alongside `vue-loader` v15+, since it no longer uses consolidate
